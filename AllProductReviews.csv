"Honest review of an edm music lover
","No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.

"Really good and durable.
","i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.

"Great purchase with minor flaws here and there.
","Its an awesome purchase but the mike doesn't quite cancel the surrounding noise that well...The other person on the call just hears too much for your liking as well as while playing music the bass isn't that great..but good enough at this pricing.

"Fake product
","The product i recieved is not even original. This is really disappointing i saw the same earphones at croma which were genuine and sound quality was way better than these. Material used for this product is awful.

"Good headset if you don't mind what I've stated below
","I bought these a few days back and after a lot of thought. Here's my impression:PROS:1. Sound quality - these Bluetooth earphones are quite clear and crisp which I loved, however I find that on call and even in general the volume output is low so often you have to keep it on maximum which I don't think it's heathy at all.2. Noise cancellation - these earphones have zero noise cancellation since they are not earbud style, so if you are in noisy traffic chances are you will struggle to hear music and the caller on the line3. Bluetooth range - the range is good, you can get as far as one room away with no distortion nor disturbance which is very pleasant, I really liked that. However it struggles to stay connected should you travel any further than that. Decent range, works for me4. Built quality - the build quality is as can be expected for an earphone in the range but even then it's good, well finished and the flat cable really does help quite a bit to keep from a tangled mess!5. Battery life - with medium usage it lasted me close to 1Â½ days on a single charge which is not shabby.CONS:1. The design of the headset with the battery on the one side and the microphone unit on the other is very flawed because inadvertently if you are using only one earphone the battery unit pulls the microphone to the back of your head and you have to constantly adjust. It happens even when you wear both, either a neckband on the section that goes around or even a clip to tighten the wire on the back of the head would have been a good addition2. The earphones - I found that since these rest just inside the ear opening they need constant adjusting as they tend to shift as you are working or moving, plus my ears started hurting a little as some point, not to the extent of returning these or not keeping them in but I believe providing mini ear hooks would have been a good idea so that they keep the earphones snug and immobile

"Pathetic Audio Quality
","I like to think of myself as an audiophile, and trust me I have tried numerous earphones, but by far these are my worst pick.The audio quality is Terrible, it's super flat. As much as you are tempted to buy them, DON'T!Even audio technical clr100 & JBL c150 si sounds mcuh better than these.I  extremely Regret buying these
